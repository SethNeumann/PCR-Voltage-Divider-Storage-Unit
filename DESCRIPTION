SuperCapacitor Energy Storage Unit for a DCC decoder with voltage divider

This is an alternative to the PCR-KA which uses a zener diode and relies on the capacitors having 
similar capacitance and internal resistance prevent accidental over-voltage.  This design uses
a network of 10K resistors to equalize voltage across the capacitors.  the 1F supercaps in the
PCR (Larry Puckett) design actually have too much storage capacity, so this design used .22F 
supercaps (x6 as they are 2.5V devices).
