Voltage-Divider-Storage-Unit is comonly calle d a keep-alive but that's someone's
trademark.  It helps DCC decoders get over dead spots and dirty track, epecially
important for sound equipped locos.  I layed out a board for the Larry Puckett 
design but was urged to do this one as it's more reliable, long term.

Difference is use of a voltage divider network to protect 6 .22F 2.5V supercapacitors
as opposed to 5 1F 2.7V protected by a zener.
